# MazeSolver
**MazeSolver** is a project made for the **Salerno University of Studies**'s course named "Artificial Intelligence Basis" (Fondamenti di Intelligenza Artificiale).

The project has one default maze and the exit is found by using some Search Algorithms studied in the course.
# How to run it
**YOU'LL NEED JAVA JDK >= 8.0**

**BUG ALERT:** 
Unfortunately the project has a bug i couldn't resolve :(

When the program is executed it might appear only a black screen. Minimize the window and then bring it back on foreground to see the maze. I'm not handy with javax.swing library, sorry for the trouble. 

* Download the zip
* Open the command prompt
* Change the current directory to the "src" folder 
* Compile the Main class (javac Main.java)
* Execute the Main class (java Main)
* Try out the algorithms implemented clicking on the buttons
